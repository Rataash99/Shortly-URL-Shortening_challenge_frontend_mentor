## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- API
- LocalStorage

### What I learned

I haven't used localStorage for a long time so this project helped me out remembering concepts of local storage and helped me understanding API's. 

code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="home">
          <div class="home-left">
            <h1 class="hl-tagline">More than just shorter links</h1>
            <p class="hl-para">
              Build your brandâ€™s recognition and get detailed insights on how
              your links are performing.
            </p>
            <button class="hl-btn btn">Get Started</button>
          </div>
          <div class="hr-img">
            <img
              src="./images/illustration-working.svg"
              alt="#"
              class="hr-img"
            />
          </div>
        </div>
```
```css
.btn2{
    border-radius: 5px;
    border: none;
    padding: 0.8rem;
    font-weight: bolder;
    color: white;
    background: hsl(180, 66%, 49%);
    transition-duration: 0.5s;
}
.btn2:hover{
    background: hsl(180, 53%, 73%);
    cursor:pointer;
}
```
```js
const fetchData = () => fetch(`https://api.shrtco.de/v2/shorten?url=${url}`)
.then(res => res.json())
.then((result) => {
    localStorage.getItem('links');
    let ans = result.result.short_link2;
    let li = document.createElement('li');
    li.innerHTML = 
    `<p class = "url">${url}</p>
    <hr class = 'li-hr'>
    <div class = 'li-right-div'>
    <p class = "short-url">https://www.${ans}</p>
    <button onclick = "copyText('${ans}')"  class = 'copy btn3'>Copy</button>
    </div>`;
    listData.append(li);
    localStorage.setItem('links', listData.innerHTML);
})
```

### Continued development

Planning to build some projects using tailwind / bootstrap and REACT
